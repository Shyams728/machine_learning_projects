# Kannada MNIST Project

Welcome to the Kannada MNIST Project repository! This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to recognize handwritten digits from the Kannada MNIST dataset. The Kannada MNIST dataset is similar to the original MNIST dataset but contains images of digits written in Kannada, a language predominantly spoken in the Indian state of Karnataka.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify handwritten Kannada digits. The project notebook provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and results visualization processes.

## Dataset

The Kannada MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into:
- Training set: 60,000 images
- Test set: 10,000 images

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

## Installation

To run the project notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Additionally, you need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shyams728/machine_learning_projects.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd machine_learning_projects
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Kannada_MNIST_Project.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the project step by step.

## Project Structure

The project repository has the following structure:

```
